#functions = a block of code which is executed only when it is clled!!

#def hello():
#    print("hello!")
#    print("have a nice day!")
#hello()

#def hello(first_name,last_name,age):
#    print("hello "+first_name+" "+last_name)
#    print("your age is "+str(age)+" years old")
#     print("have a nice day!")
#hello("xiang","tzu",25)
#hello("jack")

#****an important feature of functions
# is we can send information to our function(it could be str,variable,collection.....etc anything!!) ****
#                                  the information we pass is called an **argument**
#**another way of writting code**
#def hello(first_name,last_name,age):
 #   full_name = first_name + last_name
#    print("hello "+full_name)
#    age = str(age)
#    print("your age is "+age+" years old")
#    print("have a nice day")
#hello("xiang","tzu",25)

#return statement = a statement used within a function to send python value/object back to the caller!!**
#                    ***and these value/objects known as function's return value!****

#def multiply(number1,number2):
#    result = number1 * number2
#    return result
#x = multiply(6,7)
#y = multiply(3.8,4)
#print(x)
#print(y)

#def multiply(a,b):
#    r = a * b

#print(x)

#def multiply(number1,number2):
#    result = number1*number2
#    return result

#x = multiply(6,7)

#def multiply(a,b): #way of writting code in less lines!!
#    return a*b
#x = multiply(3,4)
#print(x)
